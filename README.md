# cp-comp-challenge-1
  This is my static comp challenge 1.
  
  I have to say this was much more challenging than I originally thought and therefore ended up starting it over the weekend. 
Im really glad I did because it took a little bit longer than I intended. 

  I ended up doing the grid garden and flex box froggy games online which ended up giving me a good starting point on how to
lay this out with grid and get everything positioned correctly using flexbox. I got the icons from a flat icons database and the
files themselves have accredation to the author inside of them.

  I chose huskies because A: I love them, duh. and B: huskies are a breed that I wish people knew more about before they buy
them as they need a LOT of extra care compared to most dogs.

  In the future I may actually make a site to help educate people on the not quite so tame or graceful breed most people think
they are.
